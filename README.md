# SGDo
Numerical verification of convergence rates of SGDo.

Use python 2.7 to run LowerBound_n.py and LowerBound_K.py.

Use python 3.7 to run plot_n.py and plot_K.py. 

LowerBound_n.py and LowerBound_K.py run the experiments and store data in the 'plotdata' directory.

plot_n.py and plot_K.py create plots for the respective data.

For faster runs, try setting 'reps=10' in LowerBound_n.py and LowerBound_K.py.
